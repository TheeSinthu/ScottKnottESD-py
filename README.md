# ScottKnottESD-py

This repository provides a **Python implementation** of the Scott-Knott Effect Size Difference (ESD) test, originally implemented in R by [ScottKnottESD](https://github.com/klainfo/ScottKnottESD).

The Scott-Knott ESD test is a ranking and clustering procedure to compare multiple treatments with Statistical and Effect Size test. Each ranked cluster's performance must be both statistically significant with large effect size.
